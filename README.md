# mvq - Matrix, vector and quaternion routines

A simple and lightweight header-only C++ library for vectors, matrices and quaternions, focused on use in computer graphics.

Not optimized for speed, but not inefficient either ;-)

Note: the py/ subdirectory is very much out of date and not to be used...
